### AIM : Implementing Support Vector Machine using Python.

Software used : Python 3.7.3

In machine learning, kernel methods are a class of algorithms for pattern analysis, whose best-known member is the support vector machine (SVM). The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations in datasets.
