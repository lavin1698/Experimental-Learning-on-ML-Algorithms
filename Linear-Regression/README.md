### AIM : Implementing Linear Regression using Python.
<br>
Linear regression is used in the field of predictive analysis.
Regression helps us to give the following insights.
> Whether predictive variables do a good job in predicting outcome variable.
> Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable and how they influence it.
> The simplest form of regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula y=c + b*x, where y=estimated dependent variable score, c=constant, b=regression coefficient, and x= score on the independent variable and it helps us to define the relationship between the variables.
