### AIM : Implementing K-means Clustering using Python.

Software used : Python 3.7.3
K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing. K-means clustering aims to partition observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.
